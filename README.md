# Snake Neural Network
_(Sorry, shortening names like that can bug me)_

Using Java as my language of choice, I plan on finally getting into the realm of machine learning. My ultimate goal is to mix deep learning with the lottery, but for this project I'll stick with snake: Cool gif that lead to the code-along below: https://imgur.com/gallery/pXJuy.

This was created thanks to [hamstap85](https://github.com/hamstap85) and our mutual interest in the above field. 
The same conditions apply, to quote " 
[ I'll start with a standard 20x20 area, random food placement, and eventually make a random size area as well. ](https://github.com/hamstap85/SnakeNeuralNet)

I chose Java because it's the language I'm most familiar with. My choice has nothing to do with Java - I hate the taste of coffee.
